            The base was a project I made earlier, which was just prototyped blocks for parkour. I added the wall materials, lava blueprint, and lava and platform textures.

            Getting the textures to tile correctly was a bit challenging, I had to edit the tile node in the material because for the walls I used stretched cubes.
            Aside from that it was fairly straight forward, it was fun to use emissive textures and figuring out how to make the laval reset the player was fun.
